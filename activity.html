   <h3>Traditional Water Fight</h3>
   <p>Every year, after the second exams, all students fight in the garden of school. Some of them bring lots of water balloons or nerfs. Others buy all water bottles in the school's canteen and pierce the caps of bottles. This has become a tradition of our school and also teachers attend in it. </p>

   <h3>Graduation Ceremony</h3>
   <p>Students who will graduate in that year prepare a march that contains behaviours of teachers, criticism about school management and their specific memories in Beşiktaş Anatolian High School. In addition to that, they prepare banners about school by themselves in order to hang on walls. After singing the anthem together and dancing with songs, they jump into the cold Marmara Sea. Some alumni who graduated a year ago come with a boat and greet new graduated students.
