     <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Nadide Bilge Doğan but I prefer Bilge. I graduated from Beşiktaş Anatolian High School in 2019 and this is my second term in the Computer engineering department due to the fact that I'm an irregular student.  Why did I choose this department? Actually, I had not made  any decision about which profession I wanted. After the results of the university entrance exam, I thought about this but did not decide because of confusion. I still do not know which was the best for me but I am trying to not  let my family notice :) I did not want a career in medicine as a consequence I chose this department. This is not a single reason. I am interested in coding, robotics and space also. Learning new things and always staying as a student, define me. I have some plans for the future but before that I have to improve myself.
